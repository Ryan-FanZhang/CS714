- The median income attribute does not look like it is expressed in dollars. When asked, the team that collected the data tells you that 1. the numbers roughly represent tens of thousands of dollars (e.g. 3.0 is approximately $30 000) and 2. The data was scaled and capped at 15 (actually 15.0001) for higher median incomes, and at 0.5 (median) for lower median incomes. Working with preprocessed attributes is common in machine learning, and it is important to understand how the data was computed.

- The housing median age and the median house value were also capped (see the large bin at the end of the distribution). The cap on the median house value might be a serious problem as this is the target we want to predict. The model might learn that the house value never goes higher than $500 000, while this last bin might include house values higher than $500 000. In that case, you need to refer to the task (e.g., check with your client) to see if this is a problem. If the task requires precise predictions beyond $500 000, you will either need to collect more precise labels for the values that were capped, or you can decide to remove the capped instances from the dataset (in that case, your model might not perform as well for house values greater than $500 000. 

- The attributes have different scales (look at the y axis). This might require some feature scaling/normalisation. 

- The distibution of the values for several attributes is skewed (not centred on the median). This might make the training of models harder as it makes it harder to detect a "typical" pattern. This might require some transformations to have a more symmetrical / Gaussian shape distribution for these attributes.
