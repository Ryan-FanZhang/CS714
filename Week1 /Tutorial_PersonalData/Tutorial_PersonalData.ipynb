    "\n",
    "There is a large number of reasons for adversaries to gain access to raw data -- a few of them are discussed above. However, recently, attacks are often focussed on machine learning models trying to extract sensitive information from model outputs. [[read more](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3624010)]\n",
    "\n",
    "Particularly, an adversary might want to use a trained model to:\n",
    "- determine if a specific input sample was used for training or not. This type of \"attack\" can also be seen from a different perspective, for example, an artist might want to know if a generative model (such as DALL-E) used their artwork without authorization.\n",
    "- recover the entire training data \n",
    "- recover specific sensitive attributes of a targeted user from model outputs\n",
    "- extract dataset properties that were not directly encoded as features, for example, the gender ratio of a patient dataset even if it was not an attribute. This is an interesting approach to identify implicit bias in models."

    "#### 2.4 PCA-based Privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "One popular approach to enhance privacy while retaining crucial information for machine learning is to transform the dataset using [Principal Component Analysis (PCA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis). [[read more](https://blogs.ed.ac.uk/datasciencecdt/2020/03/31/using-pca-to-preserve-privacy/)]\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique used to transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving as much variance as possible. It identifies the principal components, which are orthogonal linear combinations of the original features, allowing for simplified data representation and visualization. \n",
    "\n",
    "By representing the data in a more compact form, PCA can help mitigate the risk of re-identification and protect sensitive information, making it more challenging for adversaries to infer individual identities from the transformed data. Additionally, PCA does not rely on individual feature values, making it harder for attackers to reconstruct the original data and preserve the privacy of individuals."

    "#### 2.5 Differential Privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "[Differential privacy](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11787006_1) is a framework for protecting the privacy of individuals in datasets while allowing useful insights to be extracted from the data. This makes it an ideal pre-processing step for machine learning purposes, and it is in fact the state-of-the-art. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Roughly, an algorithm is differentially private if an observer seeing its output cannot tell whether a particular individual's information was used in the computation. [[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy#cite_note-hilton08-1)]\n",
    "\n",
    "Differential privacy achieves this by adding carefully calibrated noise or randomness to the data, ensuring that the statistical properties of the data are preserved while obscuring the contribution of any specific individual. \n",
    "\n",
    "Differential privacy also involves concepts such as privacy budget, which quantifies the amount of privacy loss that can occur over multiple queries or analyses, and compositionality, which ensures that the privacy guarantees hold even when multiple analyses or queries are performed on the same dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple packages in Python that implement differential privacy:\n",
    "- [PyDP](https://pydp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is a Python wrapper for Google's [Differential Privacy](https://github.com/google/differential-privacy) project\n",
    "- IBM's [Diffprivlib](https://github.com/IBM/differential-privacy-library) with documentation [[here](https://diffprivlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)], which offers algorithms similar to sklearn but with differential privacy. We will use this package below in a comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantage of Differential Privacy is that it provides **provable privacy guarantees**."
